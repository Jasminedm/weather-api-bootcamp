This site allows the user to input their city and country to see the current weather in that city using an api. I programmed the users City input to request a response from the current weather api based on its data.

While designing this I learned how to use an api and understand it documentation. This project can be improved and become more accurate if I go back to understand the documentation and allow it to take in the country as well as the city.

Skills:  JS / HTML / CSS / API
